# LLMap Development Plan - Enhanced OCR + AI Pipeline

## Phase 1: Enhanced OCR + AI Pipeline Implementation (2 weeks)

### Week 1: Context-Preserving OCR Foundation
- [x] Project structure setup
- [ ] Enhanced OCR processor (context preservation)
- [ ] Content-type detection system
- [ ] Structured chunk output system
- [ ] Multi-language OCR coordination

### Week 2: AI Semantic Processing & Integration
- [ ] AI semantic processor (GPT-4/Claude integration)
- [ ] Context-aware location extraction
- [ ] AI-powered geocoding service
- [ ] Relationship mapping system
- [ ] Enhanced map visualization with AI-enriched data

## Strategic Task Division

### Member A (Frontend + AI Integration Focus)
**Week 1:**

- [ ] Multi-language content handling UI

**Week 2:**
- [ ] AI processing status indicators
- [ ] Enhanced map visualization with semantic data
- [ ] Relationship visualization (trails→parks, etc.)
- [ ] AI-enriched export functionality

### Member B (Enhanced OCR + AI Backend Focus)
**Week 1:**
- [ ] Context-preserving OCR processor
- [ ] Content-type detection algorithms
- [ ] Structured chunking system
