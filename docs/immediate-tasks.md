- Image preview with detected content type (social media, travel, map)
- Upload progress with AI processing stages
- Multi-language content indicators

**Files to create**:
- `frontend/components/EnhancedFileUpload.jsx`
- `frontend/components/ContentTypeDetector.jsx`
- `frontend/components/AIProcessingStatus.jsx`

### ✅ Task 2: AI-Enhanced Map Visualization (1 day)
**What to build**:
- Map component with semantic location markers
- Relationship visualization (trails→parks, restaurants→districts)
- AI confidence indicators on markers
- Context-rich location popups

**Files to create**:
- `frontend/components/AIEnhancedMap.jsx`
- `frontend/components/SemanticMarker.jsx`
- `frontend/components/RelationshipVisualizer.jsx`

### ✅ Task 3: Structured Results Display (0.5 day)
**What to build**:
- Display OCR chunks with spatial context
- AI semantic processing results
- Confidence scores and processing pipeline status
- Multi-language content handling

## 🎯 Member B (Enhanced OCR + AI Backend) - Parallel Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Context-Preserving OCR Processor (1 day) - **CRITICAL**
**What to build**:
- Enhanced OCR that preserves spatial relationships
- Content-type detection (social media, travel itinerary, maps)
- Structured chunk output with context
- Multi-engine coordination (PaddleOCR + Tesseract)

**Files to create**:
- `backend/enhanced_ocr_processor.py`
- `backend/content_type_detector.py`
- `backend/contextual_chunker.py`

### ✅ Task 2: AI Semantic Processing Layer (1 day) - **CRITICAL**
**What to build**:
- GPT-4/Claude integration for semantic understanding
- Context-aware location extraction
- Fuzzy matching and error correction
- Multi-language semantic processing

**Files to create**:
- `backend/ai_processor.py`
- `backend/semantic_extractor.py`
- `backend/intelligent_geocoder.py`

## ✅ COMPLETED: Enhanced OCR + AI Pipeline Implementation

### 🎉 Major Achievement: Strategic Architecture Implemented
We have successfully implemented the **Enhanced OCR + AI Pipeline** strategy, representing a fundamental shift from rule-based to AI-powered location extraction.

### ✅ Completed Components

#### Backend (Enhanced OCR + AI)
- [x] **Context-Preserving OCR Processor** (`enhanced_ocr_processor.py`)
  - Multi-engine coordination (PaddleOCR + Tesseract)
  - Content-type detection (social media, travel, maps)
  - Structured chunking with spatial context
  - Multi-language support (Chinese/English mixed)

- [x] **AI Semantic Processing Layer** (`ai_processor.py`)
  - GPT-4 integration for semantic understanding
  - Context-aware location extraction
  - Fuzzy matching and error correction
  - Relationship mapping between locations

- [x] **Intelligent Geocoding Service** (`intelligent_geocoder.py`)
  - AI-enhanced query optimization
  - Context-aware geocoding
  - Multi-service support (Google + Nominatim)
  - Batch processing with confidence scoring

#### API Endpoints
- [x] **Enhanced Processing Endpoints**
  - `POST /api/ai/process-image` - Single image with AI pipeline
  - `POST /api/ai/process-batch` - Batch processing with AI
  - Comprehensive response structure with processing phases

#### Frontend Integration
- [x] **Updated SocialMediaOCRDemo** to use Enhanced OCR + AI Pipeline
- [x] **API Integration** switched to new AI-powered endpoints
- [x] **Results Display** enhanced for AI processing phases

#### Documentation & Testing
- [x] **Ground Truth Evaluation** framework with 8 test images
- [x] **Comprehensive Documentation** updated for new architecture
- [x] **Performance Benchmarking** system established

### 📊 Expected Performance Improvements
- **Location Extraction Recall**: 13.3% → 70-85% (5-6x improvement)
- **Multi-language Support**: Natural Chinese/English mixed content
- **Error Tolerance**: Handles OCR artifacts and variations
- **Context Awareness**: Understands semantic relationships

## 🚀 Next Immediate Actions

### Week 1: Testing & Optimization
- [ ] **Test with Real Social Media Data** from `data/social media/`
- [ ] **Run Enhanced Evaluation** using new AI pipeline
- [ ] **Optimize AI Prompts** based on performance results
- [ ] **Monitor API Costs** and implement caching if needed

### Week 2: Refinement & Deployment
- [ ] **Error Handling Enhancement** for edge cases
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring** and optimization
- [ ] **User Interface Polish** for AI processing visualization
- [ ] **Documentation Finalization** for deployment

## 🎯 Your Next Action

**Start with the FileUpload component** - it's the most visual, has no dependencies, and gives immediate satisfaction. Once you have drag-and-drop working, everything else builds on top of it naturally.
