- File validation and storage
- Return file metadata

### ✅ Task 2: OCR Integration (1 day)
**What to build**:
- Tesseract.js OR PaddleOCR integration
- Text extraction from uploaded images
- Return extracted text via API

## 🔄 Integration Point (End of Week 1)
Once both upload UI and upload endpoint are ready:
- Connect frontend upload to backend API
- Display extracted text in frontend
- Test with sample images (Yelp screenshots, social media images)
