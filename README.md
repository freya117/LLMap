# LLMap - AI-Powered Multi-Modal Mapping Platform

LLMap is an intelligent mapping platform that transforms multi-modal information (text, images, links) into interactive, AI-enhanced geographical visualizations.

## üéØ Project Vision

Transform scattered location information from various sources (social media, reviews, recommendations) into intelligent, shareable maps through AI agents.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Multi-modal Input Processing**: Images, text, links, screenshots
- **Advanced OCR Processing**: Tesseract & PaddleOCR with intelligent preprocessing
- **AI-Powered Location Extraction**: GPT-based geographical information parsing
- **Interactive Visualization**: Dynamic maps with rich context
- **Agent Integration**: MCP-compatible for AI workflow integration
- **Shareable Outputs**: High-quality exports and embeddable components

### üîç OCR Capabilities

LLMap features a comprehensive OCR system designed specifically for extracting geographic and business information from various image sources including maps, screenshots, and social media posts.

#### Dual OCR Engine Architecture
- **Tesseract OCR**: Industry-standard engine with multi-language support and optimized configurations for different text types
- **PaddleOCR**: Advanced Chinese-optimized engine with superior accuracy for Asian text and mixed-language content
- **Intelligent Engine Selection**: Automatic fallback system that chooses the best engine based on content analysis and availability
- **Performance Optimization**: Parallel processing capabilities for batch operations

#### Advanced Image Preprocessing Pipeline
- **Smart Enhancement**: Automatic contrast adjustment, brightness optimization, and sharpness enhancement using OpenCV
- **Skew Correction**: Automatic rotation correction using Hough line detection and perspective transformation
- **Noise Reduction**: Bilateral filtering, morphological operations, and Gaussian blur for text clarity
- **Image Type Detection**: Adaptive processing algorithms for maps, screenshots, social media posts, and document images
- **Resolution Optimization**: Dynamic scaling and DPI adjustment for optimal OCR accuracy

#### Intelligent Text Processing & Correction
- **OCR Error Correction**: Advanced pattern matching to fix common character confusions (0/O, 1/I/l, 5/S, etc.)
- **Text Cleaning**: Comprehensive whitespace normalization, punctuation correction, and line break handling
- **Multi-language Support**: Seamless processing of English, Chinese, and mixed-language content
- **Quality Assessment**: Confidence scoring, text quality evaluation, and reliability metrics
- **Context-Aware Filtering**: Removal of OCR artifacts and irrelevant text based on geographic context

#### Structured Data Extraction Engine
