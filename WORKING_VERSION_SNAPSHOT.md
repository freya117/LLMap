# LLMap Working Version Snapshot
**Date**: 2025-07-17 22:30:29  
**Status**: ✅ WORKING - OCR Processing Successful

## Current Performance Metrics
- **Files Processed**: 1/1 (100% success rate)
- **Locations Found**: 20 locations from IMG_3193.PNG
- **Average Confidence**: 75.3%
- **Ground Truth Matches**: 
  - ✅ "Dave's Hot Chicken" (detected as loc_4)
  - ✅ "5010 El Cerrito Pl" (detected as loc_5)
  - ✅ "El Cerrito Plaza" (detected as loc_8)

## Key Components Working
1. **Backend OCR Processor** (`backend/ocr_processor.py`)
   - Tesseract OCR engine functional
   - Image preprocessing pipeline working
   - Location extraction patterns active
   - Confidence scoring operational

2. **Backend API** (`backend/main.py`)
   - `/api/ocr/batch` endpoint functional
   - File upload handling working
   - Response structure correct

3. **Frontend Interface** (`frontend/pages/index.js`)
   - File upload component working
   - OCR test button functional
   - Results display operational
   - Standardized data export working

## Current Issues to Improve
1. **Too many false positives**: 20 locations found vs 1 expected business
2. **OCR noise**: Many garbled text extractions ("Be Veo Suse", "DAD ESS Hare nic")
3. **No ground truth comparison**: Missing automatic comparison with ground_truth.json
4. **Location type classification**: All marked as "location" instead of proper types
